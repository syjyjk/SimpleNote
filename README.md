浩渺无涯的北方水域栖息着一种名为鲲的鱼。其体型庞大难以估量，或许跨越数千里。随着形态的变化，鲲化为鸟，名为鹏。鹏背的宽广同样难以估量。



In the vast and boundless northern waters resides a fish called Kunppy. Its size is enormous and beyond measure, possibly spanning thousands of miles. During a profound metamorphosis, the Kun transforms into a bird called the Peng. The width of the Peng's back is similarly boundless, defying quantification.
